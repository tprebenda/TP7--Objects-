# TP7--Objects-
TP7 assignment for my Python class, Langages de Script (a French course that I studied while abroad, at Paris Diderot).
This assignment involved the creation of two classes: an SMS class, to recreate a texting service, 
                                                      and a Graph class, to be used in later assignments.
